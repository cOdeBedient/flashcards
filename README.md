# FlashCards
## Abstract
I built a multiple choice quiz game to be played on the command-line.<br></br>
**Features**
- gameplay is once through a deck of 30 cards.
- user receives feedback at the end letting them know percentage of correct answers and total time it took to complete.
- Minimal UI design for end information to "prettify" and leave user feeling warm and fuzzy.
